I had similar problems opening OpenOffice documents. LaunchServices insisted in consider older versions of OpenOffice as default. This behavior could be easily changed reprocessing the Info.plist of apps by lsregister. Just run ...path.../lsregister -f /Application/xxx.app for your desired default app version, and then reprocess similarly the other (non default) app versions. The first reprocessed will remain as default.
